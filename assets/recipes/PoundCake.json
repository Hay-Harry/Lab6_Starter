Pound Cake is a classic, very buttery vanilla cake commonly made in loaf form. The crumb is quite dense compared to typical cakes, but when made well, it should be moist, soft and melt-in-your mouth, as this one is!This Pound Cake recipe is based on one called\u00a0&quot;The Perfect Pound Cake&quot;\u00a0from\u00a0&quot;The Cake Bible&quot;\u00a0by Rose Levy Beranbaum. She tested it over 40 times and we\u2019ve tried it many ways as well, but couldn&#039;t improve on it. So I\u2019ve taken the liberty of changing the name here to the BEST Pound Cake. :-)Please make sure the milk, butter and eggs are at room temperature, as directed in the recipe. This is especially important for Pound Cake.","datePublished":"2021-06-18T15:00:00+00:00","image":["https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pound-Cake_4-SQ.jpg","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pound-Cake_4-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pound-Cake_4-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pound-Cake_4-SQ.jpg?w=480&h=270&crop=1"],"recipeYield":["10"],"prepTime":"PT20M","cookTime":"PT50M","totalTime":"PT100M","recipeIngredient":["3 tbsp milk (, full fat, at room temperature)","3  large eggs (, at room temperature (150 - 165g / 6oz total including shell, Note 1))","1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract","1 cup cake flour (, sifted (if using cup measures, measure after sifting, Note 2))","3/4 cup caster sugar (superfine sugar)","3/4 tsp baking powder","1/4 tsp salt","13 tbsp (185 grams) butter, unsalted, softened to 18\u00b0C / 64\u00b0F; (Note 4)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F (165\u00b0C fan) with the shelf arranged so the loaf pan will sit in the middle of the oven.","name":"Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F (165\u00b0C fan) with the shelf arranged so the loaf pan will sit in the middle of the oven.","url":"https://www.recipetineats.com/best-pound-cake/#wprm-recipe-64473-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Prepare pan: Grease a 21.5 x 11.4 x 6.9cm / 8.5 x 4&quot; loaf pan with unsalted butter, then dust with flour, knocking out excess (Note 2)","name":"Prepare pan: Grease a 21.5 x 11.4 x 6.9cm / 8.5 x 4&quot; loaf pan with unsalted butter, then dust with flour, knocking out excess (Note 2)","url":"https://www.recipetineats.com/best-pound-cake/#wprm-recipe-64473-step-0-1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Whisk wet: In a medium bowl, lightly whisk together the milk, eggs and vanilla.
