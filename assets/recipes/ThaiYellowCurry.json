Thai curries are famous for the sublime aromatic flavours balancing sweet, tart, savoury and spiciness. Thai Yellow Curry is one such magnificent example, with its rich yellow colour, incredible depth of flavour and a heady combination of both fresh and ground herbs and spices.This is made from scratch with a homemade Yellow Curry Paste. There are quite a few ingredients involved but if you truly want the best, it&#39;s worth it!This is a creation the RecipeTin Team is proud to call our own - we worked damn hard on it! (Then we celebrated by making another 100 as the first meals we donated through RecipeTin Meals \u2764\ufe0f)SPICINESS: Adjust by varying fresh chilli. Use 1 for extremely mild, 2 for quite mild, 4 for spicy (but not blow-your-head off).","datePublished":"2021-08-23T15:00:00+00:00","image":["https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Thai-Yellow-Curry_30-SQ.jpg","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Thai-Yellow-Curry_30-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Thai-Yellow-Curry_30-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Thai-Yellow-Curry_30-SQ.jpg?w=480&h=270&crop=1"],"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT30M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT60M","recipeIngredient":["10  dried red chillis ((~6cm/2.5&quot; long), chopped into 1cm / 0.5&quot; pieces (Note 1))","1 - 4  fresh birds eye chillis (, deseeded, roughly (1 for extremely mild, 4 for fairly spicy, Note 2))","2  lemongrass stems ((Note 3))","1 large or 2 small  eschalots (, roughly chopped (~ 1/2 cup) (Note 4))","2 tbsp fresh turmeric (, finely grated (about 2cm / 0.8&quot; piece) (Note 5))","2 tbsp galangal (, finely grated (about 2cm / 0.8&quot; piece) (Note 6))","8 cloves garlic (, roughly chopped)","1 1/2 tbsp Thai shrimp paste in bean oil ((Note 7))","1 tsp ground coriander","1 tsp ground cumin","1/4 tsp ground cardamom","1/2 tsp fenugreek powder ((Note 8))","1/8 tsp white pepper ((sub black))","3 tbsp vegetable oil ((or canola or peanut oil))","1  medium potato (, peeled, cut into 2.5cm / 1\" pieces x 1cm/ 0.4\" thick (Note 9))","1  small carrot (, peeled, sliced into 5mm / 0.2\" slices on the diagonal)","1 cup chicken stock (, low sodium)","300 ml / 10oz   coconut cream ((Note 10))","4 tsp fish sauce (, plus more to taste (Note 11))","5 tsp white sugar","2 tsp tamarind puree ((Note 12))","350g / 12oz  prawns/shrimp (, medium, peeled, tail on optional (700g/1.4lb unpeeled) (Note 13))","1/2 cup bamboo shoots (, canned, drained, loosely packed (Note 14))","16  Thai basil leaves ((highly recommended, Note 15))","1  Red chilli (, finely sliced (optional, use large for not spicy))","2 tbsp Crispy fried shallots ((optional, store bought, Note 16))","Jasmine rice"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"Curry Paste:","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Soak dried chillis: Roughly chop chillies and transfer to bowl, leaving behind seeds.
